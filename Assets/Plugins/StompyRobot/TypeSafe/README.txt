TypeSafe scans your project and generates strong-typed static classes from your resources, layers and tags. Using these classes instead of 'naked-strings' in your code will dramatically reduce the number of runtime errors caused by mistyping, moving or renaming resources, layers or tags.

For detailed documentation, visit the web page at https://www.stompyrobot.uk/tools/typesafe/documentation

Trigger a scan from the Assets menu (Assets/TypeSafe Refresh)

The settings and welcome windows can be opened from the Window menu (Window/TypeSafe)
